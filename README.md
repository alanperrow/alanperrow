#### Linux/Unix shell in C++
Allows for basic shell operations in a Linux/Unix environment's CLI: https://github.com/alanperrow/COP4600-mysh

#### Enterprise Computing with Java
 * GUI application that simulates an e-store, including: stocking, shopping cart, invoice creation, and transaction log output
 * Bank account simulation made with synchronized threads, including deposits and withdrawals
 * GUI client application that allows SQL queries and updates to interact with a locally hosted mySQL server
 * Three-tier distributed web-app for executing MySQL queries and updates through a browser onto a remote database, updating certain data via business logic. Architecture consists of:
   * front-end HTML/JSP webpage
   * Tomcat container for servlet and business logic
   * back-end MySQL database server

#### Real-time Raytracer
Final group project for my Computer Graphics (CAP4720) course: https://observablehq.com/d/3517bd61d2e87b9a

#### MERN Stack Morse Code Translator/Messenger
Web and mobile app that sends and translates a userâ€™s messages from English to Morse code, to be received and translated back to English by another user: https://github.com/oamer6/Group-9

#### LAMP Stack Contact Manager
Manages usersâ€™ associated list of contacts and their info with CRUD operations: https://github.com/ReaganChapman/Group-9-COP4331

#### PL/0 Compiler
Compiler for the simple programming language PL/0 written in C. Compilation process includes: lexical analyzer, parser, code gen. Executes on a stack-based virtual machine.

## Learning
Sharpening skills in Python, particularly in machine learning

Applying skills learned from Observable and REGL to other graphic libararies such as OpenGL and WebGL
